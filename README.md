# xnor-desktop-client

this is the desktop client for the xnor chat app I've been making since may
it's not a huge thing, just a project for me to learn some stuff

roadmap:
- maybe change to javafx to make the whole thing look better cause swing is kinda old
- deleting chats
- leaving chats
- blocking other users
- some basic permissions for idk kicking and banning users (later hopefully will expand on that)
- make an android client
- uhhhhhh ummmmmmmmm
