this is the desktop client for the xnor chat app I've been making since may
it's not a huge thing, just a project for me to learn some stuff

## Prerequisites
[Java 8/1.8](https://openjdk.java.net/projects/jdk8/) and I think that's all it should just work

## Installation
install the jar from the [releases tab](https://github.com/jacekpoz/xnor-desktop-client/releases) and umm that's it

## Usage
what the fuck man come on just use it you'll figure it out it should be intuitive I think but if it's not you can insult me

## Contributing
the client code is spaghetti right now so if anyone does a pull request I'll pull that bitch like the rope in tug of war
